Github API CLI Tool
=

Overview
-

This project started out as me wanting to create a basic application to allow for the creation of repositories from my terminal. After getting some basic functionality, I've realized that there's a lot to explore within the Github API and I'm planning to build some of this functionality in soon.

Current Features
-

-	Ability to grab / update an oauth token
-	Ability to create a repository

Coming Features
-

-	DB Driven help / cli option parser
-	Want to put my help / docs in an external library
-	Use request instead of urllib2 library for my main requests
-	Build a modular system to get basic functionality optimized
